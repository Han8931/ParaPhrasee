# ParaPhrasee - Paraphrase Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning

The thesis and repo associated with the article Paraphrase Generation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The code is not intended to run end-to-end for new applications and is instead meant to be used as starter code or for taking code snippets. 

On page 29 of the thesis there is a full list of the different modules and a brief description. Please send me an email at andrewgbravo@gmail.com if you would like one of the specific modules not contained in the repo.
